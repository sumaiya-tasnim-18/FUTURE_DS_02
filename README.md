# FUTURE_DS_02 – Marketing Campaign Performance Tracker Dashboard & Analysis 

This repository shows my TASK-02 of "Data Science & Analytics internship" in "Future Interns" website (India). It focuses on analyzing marketing campaign data using Python and Power BI to extract actionable insights on customer engagement, spending patterns, and campaign efficiency.

# 📇 Project Overview

# ╰┈➤📝 Steps Breakdown

• Step 1: Explored and understood the raw marketing dataset; performed initial cleaning in Python, handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing inconsistent entries.
• Step 2: Transformed and structured the dataset, created calculated columns, and prepared a clean version ready for Power BI analysis.
• Step 3: Developed DAX measures for Total Engagements, Total Revenue, Cost per Engagement (CPE), Average Purchases per Customer, Engagement Rate, and Total Spending; structured KPIs for the dashboard.
• Step 4: Built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard featuring Donut, Pie, Line, Clustered Bar, Clustered Column, and Gauge charts; implemented dynamic filtering by Year, Marital Status, Education, Country, Kidhome, Teenhome, and Response.
